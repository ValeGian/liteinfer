# Roadmap

Fine-grained backlog of possible future work. Items are grouped by
area, not priority.

## Item template

Each item starts with a status badge and an optional PR list, followed
by the substantive bullets:

```
### N.N <Title>
- **Status.** `planned` | `in-progress` | `landed`
- **PRs.** _none yet_ | #12, #14
- **Why.** <user-facing benefit>
- **Scope.** <files / surfaces touched>
- **Parity test.** <how correctness is pinned>
```

## Shipping an improvement

Every change that claims to make liteinfer faster follows the same loop: the
claim is backed by a number measured the same way before and after, and a
general improvement that wins outright replaces the path it beats rather than
sitting beside it. A specialised improvement — one that only applies under some
precondition — joins instead. Step 6 is where that is decided.

**1. Measure the baseline.** The config being improved must already have stored
results in `benchmarks/results/`. If it does not, run it first — a claim needs a
before.

**2. Add the config, not a branch.** New work is a `BenchmarkConfig` entry in
`benchmarks/configs.py` whose `baseline` names the config it improves on. That
is what makes `bench report` print the 1:1 delta.

**3. Measure the right thing.** The two modes answer different questions, and
using the wrong one hides the effect:

| The change affects | Run | Read |
|---|---|---|
| how much work fits at once (batching, scheduling, memory) | `throughput` | tok/s, req/s |
| how long one step costs (kernels, cache layout, attention) | `latency` | ITL, TTFT |

Same dataset, same ISL/OSL, same sample count as the baseline. Latency runs
sequentially — `--gpus` distorts TTFT. Against vLLM, compare only at **matched
batch width**; a B=1 engine against a B=32 one measures the batch width.
Run-to-run variance is about ±4%, so an effect under ~1.1x is not an effect.

**4. Say what it cost.** Report the metric that got worse as plainly as the one
that got better. Continuous batching won throughput 4.5x and lost ~9% on
single-request ITL; both belong in the write-up.

**5. Update the docs in the same PR.** Results and analysis in
`docs/benchmarks.md`, headline numbers in `README.md`, a milestone entry with
its PR link, and the roadmap item flipped to `landed`.

**6. Does it replace, or does it join?** Two questions, in this order.

*Does it cover the whole domain of the thing it beats?* Continuous batching
serves every workload static batching served — any model, any batch size — so
static batching had no remaining reason to exist. An MoE kernel, a quantized
path, a long-context attention variant: each may win by a wide margin inside its
domain and still replace nothing, because outside that domain it does not apply.
If there is any workload the old path serves and the new one cannot, they both
stay. Two paths chosen by a precondition are not debt; they are the feature.

*If it does cover the domain, is it a clear win there?* Better on the mode the
feature targets, by more than run-to-run variance, with any regression elsewhere
small enough to state and accept.

**Both yes → delete what it beat**, in order:

   - confirm the superseded config's results are stored — that measurement is
     the only record once the code is gone;
   - flag its `BenchmarkConfig` entry `historical` so the report keeps rendering
     the progression while `bench run` refuses it;
   - delete the code, and everything that existed only to serve it;
   - **simplify what is left.** Removing one of two paths usually makes an
     abstraction pointless: a mode flag with one value, a dispatcher with one
     entry, a base class with one subclass. Collapse them in the same PR, or
     the codebase keeps the shape of a choice it no longer offers.

**Conditional win → keep both**, and say so explicitly: the config stays
runnable and its `description` names the precondition, so the report shows what
the row applies to. Measure it *inside its domain*. Comparing an MoE kernel against a dense baseline measures
the model, not the kernel — so a specialised path usually needs its own dataset
or model in the matrix, not just its own config.

Keeping a slower *general* path "just in case" is how the codebase stops being
readable, and the benchmark exists so that deleting it is safe. Keeping a
*specialised* path is not the same thing: it is the only thing serving its case.

## Marking an item done

When an item lands:

1. Flip `Status` to `landed` and append the merging PR(s) to `PRs`.
2. Move the item out of this file into `milestones.md`, under the
   current month's heading. Keep the `PRs` line so the milestone log
   has the same audit trail — **always link the PR, even before it is
   merged**. A milestone written in the same PR that delivers it knows
   its own number; `_none yet_` there is a link nobody goes back to add.
3. If a follow-up is created (e.g. v1 lands but v2 is the polished
   version), leave a stub here with status `planned` and a backlink
   to the original PR.

Number new items by area: section 2 is KV cache, 5 is engine ergonomics, 6 is
observability. Check `milestones.md` before picking a number — landed items keep
theirs.

Status badges keep half-done work visible: an item can sit at
`in-progress` with one PR linked while the remaining scope stays
listed.

## 1. Batching and scheduling

### 1.3 Chunked prefill / single-pass mixed batching
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** The current continuous-batching step issues two separate
  forward passes when newly admitted sequences (prefill) and running
  sequences (decode) coexist: one prefill pass and one decode pass.
  Chunked prefill merges both into a single forward pass by interleaving
  prefill tokens and decode tokens in the same batch tensor. This halves
  kernel launches in the common case and reduces TTFT for waiting
  sequences.
  It also bounds peak activation memory: a chunk size caps how many prefill
  tokens enter one pass, so prompt length stops setting the size of the
  largest allocation. That is the second half of the ISL 1024 failure
  (`docs/benchmarks.md`, "Long prompts are liteinfer's weak shape") — §3.3
  removes the score matrix, §1.3 caps what feeds it.
- **Scope.** Requires a flash-attention-style kernel that accepts
  per-sequence key-length metadata (block tables + variable query
  lengths). `ContinuousModelRunner` grows a `mixed_step(prefill_seqs,
  decode_seqs)` path; `AsyncLLMEngine._step` uses it once §3.3 (SDPA /
  Flash) lands. The two-pass path stays as a fallback for eager attention.
- **Pre-req.** §3.3 (Flash / SDPA attention backend).

---

## 2. KV cache implementations

### 2.2 Prefix sharing
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Multi-turn chat and few-shot batches share long prefixes;
  recomputing them dominates wall time.
- **Scope.** Subclass of paged cache that hashes prompt prefixes and
  reuses blocks. Scheduler becomes prefix-aware: pick batch members
  whose prefixes are already resident.
- **Pre-req.** §2.1.
- **Parity test.** Identical greedy output to non-shared paged cache
  on a workload designed to share prefixes.

### 2.3 Paged KV cache performance (fused kernel)
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Paged gathers non-contiguous KV blocks into a contiguous buffer before
  attention. Since the gather was vectorised that costs ~8-10% against
  native-eager (0.92x throughput at B=1, 0.90x at B=4 and on ITL), and what is
  left is memory traffic rather than overhead: the gather still copies the whole
  K/V history every decode step. A fused paged-attention kernel reads the block
  table inside the CUDA kernel and removes the copy entirely, the same approach
  as vLLM's PagedAttention.
- **Scope.** Custom CUDA/Triton kernel for block-table attention;
  `ContinuousModelRunner` switches to it for the decode pass.
- **Pre-req.** §3.3 (SDPA / FlashAttention switch) provides the entry point to
  swap in a custom attention backend.
- **Parity test.** Paged greedy output identical to eager; benchmark shows
  paged >= eager tok/s at B=1.

### 2.5 Quantized cache (KV-cache fp8 / int8)
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Memory bound on long contexts.
- **Scope.** Storage-level quant of K and V; dequant on read. Behind
  `cache_quant: str | None` flag.
- **Risk.** Quality regression on long contexts; needs a tolerance
  parity test against fp16/bf16.

### 2.6 KV pool sizing from a measured activation budget
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** follow-up to [#20](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/20)
- **Why.** #20 sized the pool as `min(affordable, reachable)`, which stops it
  hoarding VRAM it can never address. `affordable` is still a guess: a fraction
  of whatever happens to be free when `load_model` runs. Two consequences. It is
  not reproducible — the same config on the same GPU sizes differently depending
  on what else was resident a second earlier, which makes a benchmark's pool a
  property of the machine's history. And the fraction is a stand-in for the real
  question, which is how much memory the forward pass needs at full width.
- **Scope.** Two steps, in order. First move the fraction to *total* VRAM, so
  the size is a function of the config and the device only. Then replace it:
  run one worst-case forward pass at `max_num_seqs` × `max_model_len` during
  load, record peak allocation, and give the pool what is left — vLLM's
  approach. The WARNING #20 added stays useful either way; it names which of
  the two constraints bound the pool.
- **Parity test.** Pool size is identical across two loads separated by an
  unrelated allocation; profiled size leaves a forward pass at full width
  headroom to complete.

## 3. Performance optimizations

### 3.1 `torch.compile` of the forward path
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Scope.** Wrap the `ContinuousModelRunner` forward passes in `torch.compile`,
  gated by `EngineConfig.enable_torch_compile`. First call pays
  compile cost; subsequent calls run the compiled graph.
- **Risk.** Dynamic shapes (variable sequence length) defeat compile
  cache. Use `torch._dynamo` shape specialization or pad to bucket
  sizes.
- **Parity test.** Compiled vs eager: identical greedy outputs.

### 3.2 CUDA graph capture for decode
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Scope.** Capture the single-token-decode step and replay it, behind
  `enable_cuda_graph`. Continuous batching varies the decode width per
  step, so capture needs a set of graphs at padded batch sizes rather
  than one — the batch is padded up to the nearest captured width.
  Capture also removes the per-step `torch.zeros` allocation in
  `build_continuous_decode_mask` and its Python-side slice fills, which
  cost a GPU allocation plus several kernel launches every pass.
- **Pre-req.** §3.1 helps but is not strictly required.

### 3.4 Tensor parallelism (single-node)
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Scope.** Per-rank `ContinuousModelRunner` plus a process group. Layer
  weights sharded along output dim (column-parallel) or input dim
  (row-parallel) per HF `_tp_plan`. Already declared in vendored
  models.
- **Surface change.** Loader streams shards onto the right rank;
  attention layers all-reduce.

### 3.5 Let SDPA expand the grouped-query heads
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** follow-up to §3.3
- **Why.** `models/attention.py` still calls `_repeat_kv` before both kernels,
  materialising a 4x copy of K and V so 8 KV heads line up with 32 query heads.
  The profile put ~10% of decode GPU time in `clone`, almost all of it that
  copy. `scaled_dot_product_attention(..., enable_gqa=True)` broadcasts the KV
  heads inside the kernel instead, which removes the copy and the memory it
  holds. Measured viable: it dispatches on this torch and agrees with the eager
  kernel to 2 bf16 ULP.
- **Scope.** Pass `enable_gqa` from `sdpa_attention` and stop expanding on that
  path; `eager_attention` keeps `_repeat_kv`, since writing the expansion out is
  what makes it the readable reference.
- **Parity test.** Unchanged output against `eager_attention`; the win is
  `latency` mode ITL plus peak memory, so measure both.

### 3.6 Pack the batch instead of padding it
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Prompts of different lengths are left-padded, so every attention call
  needs an explicit additive mask to hide each row's pad prefix. That mask is
  what keeps liteinfer off FlashAttention: PyTorch reports "Flash Attention does
  not support non-null attn_mask", so SDPA falls to the memory-efficient
  backend. Both tile the softmax, so §3.3's memory win is unaffected — but flash
  is the faster of the two, and the padding also costs real compute on positions
  that are thrown away. Verified: the same tensors with no mask and
  `is_causal=True` make flash available.
- **Scope.** Pack the batch as one flat token run plus cumulative sequence-length
  offsets (`cu_seqlens`), the varlen entry point vLLM uses. Padding stops
  existing, so `engine/attention_mask.py` has nothing to mask and `is_causal`
  replaces it. Touches the runner's input builders, the cache's `slot_table`
  right-alignment, and the null block, which exists to absorb padded positions.
- **Unblocks.** §1.3 needs the same per-sequence length metadata to mix prefill
  and decode in one pass, so this is its prerequisite as much as its own change.
- **Parity test.** Greedy output unchanged on a variable-length batch, which is
  the case padding exists to serve.

## 4. Modeling and parity

### 4.2 Detangle remaining transformers helpers from modeling files
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Llama still imports `ROPE_INIT_FUNCTIONS` and `ACT2FN` from
  `transformers` and subclasses `PreTrainedModel`.
- **Scope.** Bring in-tree incrementally: Llama-3.x RoPE init
  (~15 lines), `ACT2FN["silu"]`. `DynamicCache` tracked separately in §2.4.
- **Parity test.** `tests/e2e/test_llama_parity.py` stays bit-exact
  vs `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.generate`.

### 4.3 Add architecture: Qwen-MoE / Mixtral / DBRX
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Exercise the dispatch table and stretch the engine to a
  classical top-k MoE.
- **Scope.** New entry in `_DISPATCH`, vendored modeling file, parity
  test.

---

## 5. Engine ergonomics

### 5.2 Incremental detokenization
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** Stop-string detection currently re-decodes the entire
  output every step (`engine/stopping.py::resolve_stop_status`). Fine
  for v0; pathological on long outputs.
- **Scope.** Cache the last decoded suffix and only decode the new
  token's contribution.

### 5.5 Backpressure on admission
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** `max_num_seqs` caps how many sequences run, not how many are
  accepted. `AsyncLLMEngine._pending` and `ContinuousScheduler.waiting` are both
  unbounded, so a caller that submits faster than the engine drains grows two
  Python lists without limit until the process dies — and it dies holding
  admitted work that never ran. Every production serving stack rejects or blocks
  instead; that liteinfer does not is a gap, not a simplification.
- **Scope.** `EngineConfig.max_waiting_seqs`, enforced in `add_request`. Decide
  the failure mode explicitly: `await` on a bounded `asyncio.Queue` gives the
  caller backpressure, raising gives it a fast 429-shaped answer. Prefer
  raising — it is visible, and a hung `add_request` is the bug this item
  exists to avoid.
- **Parity test.** Submitting `max_waiting_seqs + 1` requests raises on the
  last one and leaves the first ones running.

### 5.6 Request cancellation
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** `FINISHED_ABORTED` only ever comes from the engine aborting a failed
  forward pass (§5.4). A caller has no way to abort its own request: a client
  that disconnects mid-stream, or an `async for` that breaks out early, leaves
  the sequence running to `max_tokens`, holding a slot and its KV blocks. Under
  a bounded batch that is capacity another request could have used.
- **Scope.** `AsyncLLM.abort(request_id)` marking the sequence
  `FINISHED_ABORTED` so the scheduler evicts it and frees its blocks on the next
  step; `stream()` aborts on generator close, so breaking out of the loop does
  the right thing without the caller knowing the API exists.
- **Parity test.** Breaking out of `stream()` releases the sequence's blocks
  back to the pool within one step.

---

## 6. Observability

### 6.1 Per-request stats
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** `EngineStats` is engine-wide. Per-request TTFT, decode
  latency distribution, output length, finish reason distribution
  belong on `RequestOutput`.
- **Scope.** Track per-request first-token wall and total wall in the
  engine; surface on `RequestOutput`.

### 6.2 Live dashboard runner
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** `EngineStats` now records a `StepMetrics` per forward pass
  (§6.3), and nothing consumes it.
- **Scope.** `python -m liteinfer.dashboard` printing rolling
  prefill/decode tok/s, batch width and KV usage from the stats stream.

---

## 7. Hygiene / housekeeping

- Vectorize `Sampler.__call__` per-row loop when params are
  homogeneous across batch.
- Trim `EngineStats`: six derived throughput properties, the `on_step`
  listener and four running totals have no callers outside their own tests.
- Fix the five `reportOptionalMemberAccess` errors pyright reports on package
  code: `hf_config` and `tokenizer` are declared optional because they are
  assigned in `load_model` rather than `__init__`, so every read of them is an
  error. Either construct the runner already loaded, or keep a loaded-state
  object the type system can see. The remaining pyright output is
  `reportPrivateImportUsage` against torch's re-exports, which is noise.

---

## 8. Benchmark harness

### 8.2 Plain HuggingFace `transformers` benchmark runner
- **Status.** `planned`
- **PRs.** _none yet_
- **Why.** vLLM is a strong production baseline, but a plain
  `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.generate` runner gives a
  simpler, dependency-free lower bound and makes liteinfer's
  overhead vs raw HF visible without the vLLM install requirement.
- **Scope.** New adapter class in `benchmarks/adapters.py`, plus one
  `BenchmarkConfig` entry in `benchmarks/configs.py`.
- **Parity test.** HF runner greedy outputs match liteinfer eager
  outputs on the same prompts (already validated by existing e2e
  parity tests; benchmark runner just reuses that path).
