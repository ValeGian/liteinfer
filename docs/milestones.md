## 29-08-2026 — §8.1 ISL / OSL-controlled workloads

- **PRs.** [#15](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/15)
- **What.** Replaced the per-engine runner classes with a data-driven matrix: `benchmarks/configs.py` holds every configuration and names the one it improves on, so `bench report` scores each change against its baseline, cumulatively against its lineage root, and against vLLM at the same batch width. Both engines expose one primitive — prompts in, output lengths out — so they are timed by the same clock. `throughput` and `latency` report disjoint metric sets, because a per-request latency measured under saturation records queue position rather than the engine; ITL is derived from `(e2e - ttft) / (osl - 1)` and TTFT from a separate single-token pass, avoiding per-token hooks each engine would implement differently. Forced output length (`min_tokens = max_tokens = OSL`, `ignore_eos`) is verified every run and fails the run when violated, warmup exercises the measured path at the real ISL and batch width, and each (config, mode) runs in a fresh process. TensorRT-LLM dropped; vLLM 0.28.0 runs in-process, deleting the subprocess/venv/IPC layer, the promote/demote pinning and `main.json`. Fixed `AsyncLLMEngine`, which carried its own copy of the stop rule and ignored `ignore_eos` and `min_tokens`, silently truncating every continuous-batching run; both engines now share `engine/stopping.py`. Throughput is certified against `vllm bench throughput` to within 1% at the same shape, and latency runs sequentially because vLLM's TTFT is IPC-bound and read 24% high inside a parallel sweep.

## 12-05-2026 — §1.2 Continuous batching (`AsyncLLM`) + §5.3 Async / server interface + §5.1 Streaming output

- **PRs.** [#13](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/13)
- **What.** `AsyncLLM` exposes an asyncio interface (`async with AsyncLLM(...) as llm`, `await llm.generate(...)`, `async for event in llm.stream(...)`). `AsyncLLMEngine` runs a background asyncio Task; `ContinuousScheduler` fills empty slots from `waiting` on every step and evicts finished sequences individually. `ContinuousModelRunner` issues two forward passes per step when prefill and decode sequences coexist (single-pass chunked prefill is §1.3). Always uses `cache_mode="paged"`. Benchmark runners added for `liteinfer-continuous` and `vllm-continuous`.

## 10-05-2026 — §2.1 Paged KV cache (block-pool allocator)

- **PRs.** [#12](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/12)
- **What.** `PagedKVCache` stores tokens in fixed-size blocks drawn from a pre-allocated pool. Block table maps logical sequence positions to physical block slots. `cache_mode="paged"` enabled in `EngineConfig`. Foundation for prefix sharing (§2.2) and continuous batching (§1.2). Initial overhead vs eager: ~13% throughput, ~19% E2E latency at B=1 (Llama-3.2-1B).

---

## 10-05-2026 — §2.4 Native eager KV cache (plain tensors, no `DynamicCache`)

- **PRs.** [#11](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/11)
- **What.** `NativeEagerKVCache` stores per-layer `(K, V)` as plain tensors; duck-types `DynamicCache.update()` so attention layers consume it transparently. New `cache_mode="native_eager"`. Perf matches `EagerKVCache` (1.12× vs RECOMPUTE, Llama-3.2-1B B=1).

---

## 09-05-2026 — §1.1 Static batching with B > 1

- **PRs.** [#10](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/10)
- **What.** Raises batch size from B=1 to `max_num_seqs`. Variable-length prompts left-padded; additive attention mask (`attention_mask.py`) threaded through `forward`. Strict-static: batch enters and exits together, early finishers wait. Llama (single tensor) and Gemma4 (full/sliding dict) both supported.

---

## 07-05-2026 — §4.1 e2e parity test vs `transformers`

- **PRs.** [#3](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/3)
- **What.** `tests/e2e/test_llama_gpu.py` validates bit-equivalent greedy output vs `AutoModelForCausalLM.generate` on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (3 prompts, 20 tokens). Requires CUDA.

---

## 07-05-2026 — v0: minimal end-to-end inference

- **PRs.** [#3](https://github.com/ValeGian/liteinfer/pull/3)
- **What.** First working inference path: local safetensors loading, Llama + Gemma4 dispatch, KV cache (eager / none), greedy sampler (temperature / top-k / top-p), static batch scheduler (B=1), per-step metrics, `device="auto"`. 47 unit tests, lint + pyright clean.
